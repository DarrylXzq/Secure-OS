# Principles of Secure Operating Systems
> [!IMPORTANT]
> `Principles of Secure Operating Systems` project developed a file encryption software to ensure data security and integrity through AES-CBC encryption and SHA-256 integrity verification. The software is implemented in C with the OpenSSL library on Minix OS, enhancing the system's security performance.
